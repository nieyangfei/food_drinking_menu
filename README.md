# Design

I want to do these in order:

1. The Food/Drink Menu picture page it self.

2. Cart page.

3. Order page.

4. Sign in page.

The instructor said he wanted all the code in the main.dart.



## The Food/Drink Menu picture page it self

Look at the following list and picture. It is clear to see that the 1st part is important, and I want to do it in Grid. The 2nd part is a logo, and it can be done by drawer. The 3rd  part is search bar, and it is hard and need interaction. So, I choose do 1, 2 and 3 in sequence.

1. Goods

2. Logo.

3. Search bar.
